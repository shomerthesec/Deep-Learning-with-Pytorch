# Deep.Learning.with.Pytorch
Templates for Pytorch's Deep Learning, collected them from udacity's course for Computer Vision. 

Those Codes are not up-to-date, so you might tweak some things here and there, they were just for me so I didn't clean them neither put them in a .py format because I use keras.

Hope this helps anyone.
